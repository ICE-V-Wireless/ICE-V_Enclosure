The heat inserts are installed in the battery case from the outside.
Use a soldering iron set to 260°C (500°F). Make it cooler for caution or hotter for speed.
Remove the iron once you feel resistance increase.
They will sit about 1mm below the surface.

The battery holder piece can be optional if instead M2x10 screws are used with M2 nuts.
The holes in the top are hexagonal and sized to hold the M2 nuts.

## 3D Printing Recomendations
0.4mm nozzle
PETG
No supports
The battery holder can be done with a 0.8mm nozzle.
